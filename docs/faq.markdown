### What is Dtto?
- Dtto is an easy to use file archiving tool that works efficiently and quickly.

### Can files be deleted?
- Dtto uses a command that updates changes rather than removing or duplicating. If a sync is interrupted, the files that have been copied will be safely archivied. It's safe to re-run a sync in the case a sync is interrupted. 
- Downloading the log acts as an additional source of truth if you need to quickly verify that files were archived correctly.  

### Why would anyone make this?
- To leverage the power of rsync at an introductory level and without having to learn the command line. 

### Who is Dtto for?
- For content creators, photography enthusiasts, digital imaging technicians, or pretty much any one that wants to archive files.

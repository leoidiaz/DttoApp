### What is Dtto?

- Dtto is an easy to use file archiving tool that efficiently checks the differences between the folders you selected and only updates the changes.

### Can files be deleted?

- Dtto does not remove or duplicate files that already exist. If a sync is interrupted, the files that have been copied will be safely archivied. It's safe to re-run a sync in the case a sync is interrupted. 
- Downloading the log acts as an additional source of truth if you need to quickly verify that files were archived correctly.  

### Who is Dtto for?

- For content creators, photography enthusiasts, digital imaging technicians, or pretty much any one that wants to archive files.
- Dtto provides an introduction to efficient file archiving without having to learn the command line.

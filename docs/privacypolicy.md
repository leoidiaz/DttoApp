Dtto is built as a FREE app.
This app is provided by the developer at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information if anyone decided to use my Service.

If you choose to use my service, then you agree that the service does not have any warranty and while unlikely not responsible for any file mismangement. 

### Collection and Use

Dtto does not store or have access to any of your information. This service does not require an internet connection. All of the archiving and folder permissions you select are all on your local machine and are not persisted.

### Service Providers

The archiving on device utilizes rsync.
Dtto does not include, modify, or copy rsync but rather lets users communicate with the rsync thatâ€™s already included on their mac and without having to learn the command line.
For more information on rsync on their website here: [rsync.samba.org](https://rsync.samba.org)

If anyone would like to see the source code of Dtto, I would be happy to share it on request.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
Data collection will never happen on Dtto. 
If this privacy policy is updated, it will be mentioned within the app and on the app store details screen. 

This policy is effective as of 2022-01-22

            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
                Dtto is built as a FREE app.
                This app is provided by the developer at no cost and is intended for use as is.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page is used to inform visitors regarding my
                policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
                Information if anyone decided to use my Service.

            <h3>Collection and Use</h3>
            <p>
                Dtto does not store any of your information on a server, ever. 
                This service does not use cookies and does not require an internet connection.
                All of the archiving and folder permissions you select are all on your local machine.
            </p>
            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            <p>
                The archiving on device utilizes rsync.
                Dtto does not include, modify, or copy rsync but rather lets users communicate with the rsync thatâ€™s already included on their mac and without having to learn the command line.
                For more information on rsync on their website here: <a href="https://rsync.samba.org"

            <p>If anyone would like to see the source code of Dtto, I would be happy to share it on request.</p>    
            </p>
            <h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>
                Data collection will never happen on Dtto. 
                If this privacy policy is updated, it will be mentioned within the app and on the app store details screen.
